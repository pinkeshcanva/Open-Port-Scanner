# Open Port Scanner

This script is a basic tool for scanning open ports on a given IP address or hostname. It uses the socket module in Python to establish connections to ports on the target host, and prints a message for each open port it finds.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it from the command line and enter the host to scan when prompted. For example:

The script will then iterate through all ports from 1 to 65535, attempting to connect to each one. If a connection is successful, the script will print a message indicating that the port is open.
